# capsules
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chadicus/capsules.png)](https://travis-ci.org/chadicus/capsules)


A collection of small wrapper classes which encapsulates behavior with primitive types. This is an idea taken from rule #3 of Jeff Bay's [Object Calisthenics](http://www.xpteam.com/jeff/writings/objectcalisthenics.rtf).

    }
